MATLAB scripts for analyzing plasma oscillation spectra:

f_k_spectrum.m : computes the power spectral density in frequency-wavenumber space 
bispectrum_powertransfer.m : computes the higher order spectra and nonlinear power transfer from a three-wave coupling model
amplitude_correlations.m : implements the amplitude correlation technique for determining the direction of energy transfer between frequency bands
